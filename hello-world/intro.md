Trying React out...
---------------------------------------
todo: uncomment out the verify once I figure out what's wrong with it
todo: make step 1 just wait for the install to complete

* i think the verify shell is run against the docker container not the image therefore local variables, paths, etc cannot be used to verify.  
* todo: try a different docker image... an example react application.  to do that i would need to follow these instructions: https://www.katacoda.community/custom-environment.html#base-images
